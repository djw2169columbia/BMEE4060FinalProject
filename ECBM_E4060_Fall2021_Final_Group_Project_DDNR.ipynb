We started by loading the gene expression and methylation data for 49 cases from the 180 ATRT patients in the paper. The subtype labels from the paper are then matched with these 49 samples by sample name. The 49 samples are now split into 3 groups and can be used in a multiclass training method by autogluon. The data was split into 40 training cases and 9 test cases, 3 from each class. "
